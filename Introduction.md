# Introduction

This application is developed by **Muhammad**.  
It consists of two powerful tools:

1. **Safer Web.py** – A **lead extraction tool** that scrapes carrier data from the **FMCSA Safer Company** database.  
   - It collects valuable business details such as **USDOT Number, Cargo Carried, Phone Number, Email, and Legal Name**.
   - The data is useful for **lead generation, marketing, and logistics businesses**.

2. **Filter.py** – A **CSV data filtering tool** that refines extracted leads.  
   - It removes unnecessary data (e.g., "Not Found" values and addresses).
   - Allows filtering by **cargo type** and **date range**.
   - Outputs clean, high-quality leads in a new CSV file.

This project helps businesses efficiently extract and organize carrier leads for marketing, sales, or operational purposes.
